## German Navy (Kriegsmarine)

Enigma M1, M2 and M3 were used by the German Navy (Kriegsmarine). As these three models are functionally identical, they are usually referred to as M3. They are compatible with Enigma I but have letters on the rotors rather than numbers. The wiring of Enigma M3 is given in the table below. Rotors I to V are identical to those of the Enigma I. The same is true for UKW B and C. The three additional rotors (VI, VII and VIII) were used exclusively by the Kriegsmarine. The machine is also compatible with Enigma M4 (when the 4th rotor of the M4 is set to position 'A').
